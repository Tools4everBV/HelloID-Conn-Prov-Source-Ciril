## Introduction
The interface to communicate with CIRIL On-Premises is through a set of Oracle or SQL DB queries.

For this connector we use the Oracle database and queries.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

By using this connector you will have the ability to retrieve employee and contract data from the CIRIL HR system.

Connecting to CIRIL is done using the Oracle Data Access .dll. 
To add the Oracle .dll, Copy/Paste the Oracle.ManagedDataAccess19.23.0.dll (located in directory assets https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Source-Ciril/tree/main/assets) on HelloID agent server and specify is location in the HelloID source configuration tab

### Mappings
A basic person and contract mapping is provided. Make sure to further customize these accordingly.

### Scope

The data collection retrieved by the queries is a default set which is sufficient for HelloID to provision persons.
The queries can be changed by the customer itself to meet their requirements.
